# 👋 Hello, this is Kabeer Jamal

🎓 Recent Computer Science graduate from **Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)**, Netherlands.  

## 💡 What I Enjoy About CS  

I really enjoy **understanding how systems work under the hood**, by reading source code and tracing execution paths until system internals make sense. This approach turns debugging from guesswork into reasoning. Currently, I am working on my **Under the Hood Series**. I have already explored how `npm start` works behind the scenes, and am now diving into how `docker CLI` works to explain its internal workflow.

I also enjoy **recognizing patterns and refactoring code** because it allows me to take messy or repetitive code and turn it into something abstract, reusable, and readable, while keeping things simple and avoiding overengineering. In my **OpenLearn project**, I will be creating videos showing how I refactored code and improved structure, demonstrating the practical benefits of design patterns.

## 🌱 Beyond Code

I love explaining concepts, mentoring, and improving my soft skills. Teaching, writing, and making technical ideas accessible is something I enjoy as much as coding itself. I am also skilled in **documentation**, creating clear and structured guides, tutorials, and project notes that help others understand complex ideas easily.
